# NY-Citibike-bikesharing with Tableau

##  Project Overview:
The project presents an analysis of New York Citi Bike data, using data visualization tools to present to the investors for exploration of the viability of a bike-sharing business in Des Moines. For this analysis, I utilized Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Using the converted datatype to create a set of visualizations to demonstrate the following:
• Illustrate the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders

• Illustrate the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week

• Illustrate the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

• Finally, the new visualizations are added to the two you created in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.

###  New York Citi Bike data visualizations for August 2019
Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format Using Python and Pandas functions, the "tripduration" column was converted from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (00:00:00). After the convertion of the "tripduration" column to a datetime dataytpe, the DataFrame was exported as a CSV file to use for the trip analysis.
